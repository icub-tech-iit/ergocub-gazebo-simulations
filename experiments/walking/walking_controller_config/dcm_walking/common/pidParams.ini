# PID handling file

# All the following phases are those of the left foot. In a specific phase, a joint will have the PIDs specified in the corresponding section. If not, the default will be used (if specified, the original PID otherwise).

# Possible phases: SWING_LEFT, SWING_RIGHT, SWITCH

# Each group, except DEFAULT, contains:
#    -the field activationPhase with one of the possible phases defined above,
#    -the field activationOffset which specified the time advance/delay (if the sign is + it will be a delay) wrt the begin of the phase (OPTIONAL, default 0.0)
#    -the field smoothingTime which defines the smoothing time with which the PIDs will be changed (OPTIONAL, default 1.0)

# if 0 only the default group will be taken into consideration
